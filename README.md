  <li>Campaign banner, which is an image about the campaign</li>
  <li>Campaign goal</li>
  <li>Campaign deadline</li>
  <li>Campaugn owners email; this will be used to contact the campaign owner on the progress of the campaign</li>
  <li>Campaign ownwer thanks note which will be delivered to each contributors to the campaign.</li>
  <b>After successful fulfilment of the campaign i.e the goal has been achieved, the owner of the campaign can then withdraw funds from the campaign and it becomes        closed</b>
  <p>In a situation whereby a campaign goal is not achieved and the campaign ownwer closes the camapign, the camapign owner wont be able to withdrawafunds from the campaign except his/her own personally contributed amount to the campaign if any, then claim refund button will be available to contributors to claim their contributed amounts.</p>
